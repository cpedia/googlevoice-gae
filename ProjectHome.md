This project is base on [pygooglevoice](http://code.google.com/p/pygooglevoice/) , adapt it to Google App Engine Python environment.

This project aims to bring the power of the Google Voice API to the Google App Engine Python environment in a simple, easy-to-use manner. Currently it allows you to place calls, send sms, download voicemails/recorded messages, and search the various folders of your Google Voice Accounts. You can use the Python API to schedule calls, check for new received calls/sms, or even sync your recorded voicemails/calls.


You can refer to pygooglevoice's documentation.
Documentation and example code is available [online](http://sphinxdoc.github.com/pygooglevoice/) and provided in the [extras package](http://pygooglevoice.googlecode.com/files/pygooglevoice-0.5-extras.zip)
